Syntax Lessons Learned:
***HTML***
1. Always declare a button type (button, reset, or submit).
2. Using value as an attribute will define a default value which will be displayed in the element on page load.


***CSS***
1. Look into psuedoclasses
2. You can also declare variables to make it easier to recall a combination of settings.

***JS***
1. Objects can have key value pairs (use commas!)
2. In the beginning, you can use an object to state the 'starting' values of what you might be dealing with later on. 

*Destructuring* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIq3qLaHCIs&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified
-ES6 that makes reading and writing code a lot easier
-array/object on the right side of the equal plusSign
-can be used to combine arrays and Objects
-can be used on functions 

*Ternary Operator* 
- only JS operator that takes 3 operands
- condition followed by ?, then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a : , and finally the express to execute if the conditon is falsy. 
- used frequently in replace as shortcut for an if statement.



Lessons Learned:

1. Start Small


How to get out of Tutorial Hell:
1. Don't just follow the tutorials/projects. Deconstruct it.
---> Add my own personal touches. 
2. Look at other people's codes on Github and other places. (Look as in Google the methods that you don't know, look up terms that you don't know)
3. Contribute to open source.
4. Know when to skip/take it easy. As in when watching Tutorial video you don't have to watch the entire series or the whole video. 
5. Learn Algorithms and Data Structure(Watch the video for the reasons behind)
6. Join a community (real life or online) Go to a meetup. Hang out. Talk about programming. Do stuff.
